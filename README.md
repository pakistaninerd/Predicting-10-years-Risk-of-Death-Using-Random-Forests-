# Predicting-10-years-Risk-of-Death-Using-Random-Forests-
In this project i will build a  tree based models by predicting the 10-year risk of death of individuals from the NHANES I epidemiology dataset (for a detailed description of this dataset you can check the [CDC Website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhefs/default.aspx/)). 


During the project we will do the following:

- Dealing with Missing Data
  - Complete Case Analysis by dropping missing data
  - Imputation to fill missing data ( mean and iterativeimputer)
- Decision Trees
  - Evaluation.
  - Regularization.
- Random Forests 
  - Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search
  - Using SHAP values to understand model outputs and visualizations
